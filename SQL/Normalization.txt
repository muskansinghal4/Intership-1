Normalization Levels (1NF, 2NF, 3NF):
1NF - First Normal Form
-> Multivalued attr should not be present
-> Primary key is present in the table
-> Repeating groups
-> Duplicate rows should not be there

2NF - Second Normal Form
-> Should be in 1NF
-> No partial dependency - 
All non key attr should be completely dependent
on primary key 

3NF 
Table must be in 2NF.
-> No transitive dependencies should exist.
-> Every non-key attribute must depend on the primary key, and only the primary key.
-> If a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute, it should be moved to a separate table along with the attribute it depends on.


Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):
How does BCNF differ from 3NF? When is it typically used?
BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form) is a higher level of normalization compared to 3NF. It addresses a specific type of redundancy that 3NF might not eliminate.

Key Differences:

Dependency Rule:

3NF: Eliminates transitive dependencies where a non-key attribute relies on another non-key attribute.
BCNF: Every determinant (attribute or set of attributes that determines another attribute) in a table must be a candidate key. This ensures there are no hidden dependencies beyond the primary key.
Strictness: BCNF is stricter than 3NF, requiring an additional condition for eliminating certain types of redundancies.
